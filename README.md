# FarmerScheme

Problem statement:  Farm-Scheme is a project in Agriculture domain. It is a Java/.NET Web-based application which gives an idea to the farmers how to use e-farming to sell their products. Farmers will get new ideas to improve their productivity, they can buy and sell their products online from different cities through the process of bidding.  Farmers can use this facility and avail benefits of different schemes available which will increase their profit.  
 
Project Abstract: 
• To encourage farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices.
•  To ensure flow of credit to the agriculture sector.  
 
Mandatory Modules: 
 
USERS:  There are three types of users in the system:  
• Admin  
• Farmer 
• Bidder  
 
# Module 1- Bidding 
 
This module will focus on bidding of crops by bidders in different cities. Registered users will have access to the online market place where individuals can request their crops for auction and potential buyers can make bids.  
A seller will request for a crop auction, specifying details of the crops including quantity. A seller can see current bids and log of all crops sold. 
Bidder will specify the amount they plan to invest for the bidding process, will be able to see the crop hosted for selling.  
Admin will control the entire bidding process, approve the crop to be sold and the final bid. 
 
 
 
# Module 2 – Fasal Bima Yojna:  
 
• To provide insurance coverage and financial support to the farmers in the event of failure of any of the notified crop because of natural calamities, pests & diseases.  • To stabilize the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming.
• There will be a uniform premium of only 2% to be paid by farmers for all Kharif crops and 1.5% for all Rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid by farmers will be only 5%. The premium rates to be paid by farmers are very low and balance premium will be paid by the Government to provide full insured amount to the farmers against crop loss on account of natural calamities.  
 
## Schemes for Farmer 

The Government of India provides various schemes for farmers, but due to lack of awareness and miscommunication, farmers do not avail these benefits. Hence, we try to integrate some of the schemes like Fasal Bima Yojna and Bidding of Crops scheme. 
We are implementing a system which is automated and helps to reduce the burden on farmers as well as the system. We are providing an online means to apply and claim insurance which will help the system to work efficiently and enhance smooth handling of records. 
The bidding module will enable the farmer to place crops for auction and receive best price from auction which stabilizes the farmer’s income as well as eliminates the stress of physical sale of crops in the market. We have implemented two modules which will help the farmer to make use of technology and reduce the efforts for selling the crops.
